        <p> Hi! My name is Lindsey, and I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan. I am studying Information Analysis through the School of Information as well as minoring in Math. As a freshman, I never knew where to eat or study with friends, and having a guide with the best restaurants and study spots would have been incredibly helpful. After 2 and a half years at Michigan, I want to provide my advice and opinions on the best restaurants and study spaces in Ann Arbor! Go Blue!
